**[New World Resources](https://newworldres.com/)** | Antler/Javelin VMS Copper Projects

*June 2024 - December 2024*

- Engage with drill crews on a daily basis to monitor drilling progress, retrieve core, and facilitate communication
-etween geologists and drillers
- Quickly evaluate geology and possible mineralization of core to provide a quick-log to senior geologists
- Align track and truck mounted rigs using hand compass and electronic gyrocompass
- Drive trucks and ATVs off-road in a remote desert environment
- Perform geological mapping and sampling in rugged environments alone and with other geologists
- Stake mining claims using GPS, maps, and compass to orient in the wilderness and meet up with employees at
he end of the project
- Log diamond drilled core to determine geology, structure, mineralization, and alteration of the subsurface
ithin strongly metamorphosed volcanic rocks
- Perform geotechnical/geophysical measurements on core including XRF, magnetic susceptibility, specific gravity
nd rock quality designation
- Maintain a logging rate that allows logging and sampling of all core drilled the previous shift
- Assist with interpretation of core geology into regional geology
- Manage sampling and QA/QC of core to determine geochemical characteristic of core and potential grade
- Developed Python script to track expenses and automatically create an expense report for filing with employer
- Set up a standalone server to host network licenses for programs and created a VPN connection for geologists
o access on-site resources while working remotely
- Develop Excel spreadsheet to automatically import and organize pXRF data for easier viewing and data
anipulation
- Package, ship, and submit core samples to assay lab
- Cut core samples to prepare for shipping
- Archive and store core samples for later review
